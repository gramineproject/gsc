This directory contains pre-generated example certificates. In particular:

- `test-ca-sha256.crt` -- RSA SHA256 root CA certificate in PEM format. Loaded
  in client (attester) so that client can verify the server's certificate.
- `server2-sha256.crt` -- RSA SHA256 leaf server certificate in PEM format.
  Loaded in server (verifier), so it will send it to the client during TLS
  handshake. The Common Name field is set to
  `ra-tls-server-aks-dns.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`.
- `server2.key` -- RSA private key in PEM format. Loaded in server (verifier).

Note: These certificates should not be used in production. Here, user should
      update the server2-sha256.crt with ``Common Name`` pointing to the DNS
      name of the ra-tls-secret-prov server deployed at AKS cluster.
