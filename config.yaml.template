# Specify the OS distro that is used to build Gramine, i.e., the distro from where the Gramine build
# gets all tools and dependencies from. This distro should match the distro underlying the
# application's Docker image; otherwise the results may be unpredictable (if you specify `"auto"`,
# which is recommended, you don't need to worry about the mismatch).
#
# Currently supported distros are:
# - ubuntu:22.04, ubuntu:24.04
# - debian:11, debian:12
# - quay.io/centos/centos:stream9
# - redhat/ubi9:9.4
# - redhat/ubi9-minimal:9.4
# - registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:15.4

# If Distro is set to "auto", GSC detects the distro automatically by examining the supplied
# Docker image. Alternatively, Distro can be set to one of the supported distros mentioned above.
Distro: "auto"

# If the image has a specific registry, define it here.
# Empty by default; example value: "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8".
Registry: ""

# If you're using your own fork and branch of Gramine, specify the GitHub link and the branch name
# below; typically, you want to keep the default values though.
#
# It is also possible to specify the prebuilt Gramine Docker image (that was built previously via
# the `gsc build-gramine` command). For this, remove Repository and Branch and instead write:
#   Image:      "<prebuilt Gramine Docker image>"
#
# GSC releases are guaranteed to work with corresponding Gramine releases (and GSC `master`
# branch is guaranteed to work with current Gramine `master` branch).
Gramine:
    Repository: "https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine.git"
    Branch:     "master"
