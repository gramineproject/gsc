# Specify the OS distro. Currently tested distros are
# - ubuntu:18.04, ubuntu:20.04, ubuntu:21.04
# - debian:10, debian:11
# - centos:8
Distro: "ubuntu:18.04"

# If the image has a specific registry, define it here.
# Empty by default; example value: "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8".
Registry: ""

# If you're using your own fork and branch of Gramine, specify the GitHub link and the branch name
# below; typically, you want to keep the default values though.
#
# It is also possible to specify the prebuilt Gramine Docker image (that was built previously via
# the `gsc build-gramine` command). For this, remove Repository and Branch and instead write:
#   Image:      "<prebuilt Gramine Docker image>"
#
# GSC releases are guaranteed to work with corresponding Gramine releases (and GSC `master`
# branch is guaranteed to work with current Gramine `master` branch).
Gramine:
    Repository: "https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine.git"
    Branch:     "v1.4"

# Specify the Intel SGX driver installed on your machine (more specifically, on the machine where
# the graminized Docker container will run); there are several variants of the SGX driver:
#
#   - upstream (in-kernel) driver: use empty values like below
#         Repository: ""
#         Branch:     ""
#
#   - DCAP out-of-tree driver: same as above, use empty values
#         Repository: ""
#         Branch:     ""
#
#   - legacy out-of-tree driver: use something like the below values, but adjust the branch name
#         Repository: "https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx-driver.git"
#         Branch:     "sgx_driver_1.9"
