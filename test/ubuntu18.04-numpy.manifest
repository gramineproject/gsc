# Python's memory allocator by default creates a new arena for each thread, and each new arena
# allocates 128MB of memory. By default, NumPy creates as many threads as there are available CPU
# cores, so this may quickly deplete available enclave memory (e.g. Python eats 2GB on a 16-core
# platform). Let's restrict the number of created threads.
